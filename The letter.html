                <p>Pavan, my darling boyfriend, just saying
                    that puts a smile on my face. I know it's
                    only been over 3 months since we've
                    known eachother and a lil over 2 months
                    since we finally told eachother about our
                    feelings but it feels like l've known you
                    forever which is sort of true because we've
                    been in the same class since kindergarten
                    and separated in 2nd grade because my
                    parents decided to put me in a different
                    school. Was it a coincidence that we just
                    happen to meet after all these years? if
                    you ask me, I'd say it's destiny. Now, I'm
                    not sure you believe in destiny but I do and
                    it feels like the best thing that has
                    happened to me in a really long time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we have is surreal, I mean after what I've
                    been through in the past, I didn't think I
                    could fall in love with someone so much,
                    so much that it hurts when I miss you, it
                    hurts to just imagine you being in any pain, it makes me the happiest when you are
                    happy or when you achieve something, it
                    gets me twice as excited to watch you
                    being excited for something, it makes me
                    soo mad and sad at the same time when
                    you've not had your meals or enough
                    sleep, all in all, it makes me live and breath
                    through you and for you alongside having
                    a life of my own. It's astonishing how one
                    can make you feel so complete.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Baby, you are the most amazing man I've
                    met and I'm glad I got to you before any
                    other woman could lol. Sometimes I tend
                    to think what is it about this guy that
                    makes me go crazy for him and like I've
                    told you before, there isn't exactly one
                    reason to it but the main one is that you
                    make my inner child feel safe and
                    protected. By protected I don't mean
                    physical protection, it means you make my
                    feelings count, you respect and value it and don't look down at it. After years of
                    seeking validation for my feelings, I finally
                    got over it and learnt to accept them
                    without the need for anybody else to
                    testify. But you, you make me feel heard
                    and provide a subtle reassurance to those
                    feelings without being asked for just to let
                    me know that you are listening and are
                    present with me. It's nice to finally have
                    that in a non-toxic, non-manipulative way
                    thus, feeling safe amidst those feelings.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    You give me peace baby, I don't have to
                    worry about a thing in the world when l'm
                    with you, I do kakka but that's entirely
                    different and highly momentary but the
                    inner and mental peace you give me, is just
                    unexplainable. It's like after the entire day's
                    drama, I just wanna talk to you, listen to
                    your voice, be pampered, loved and roasted
                    and i can be that dramatic bitch to you
                    lol but giving in when you state logical shit
                    to me and then scolding you for always
                    being so practical and us making up
                    because at the end of the day we love and
                    go crazy for eachother!
                    To be honest, your practicality and
                    logicality are annoying at times, but most
                    of the days even I'm that person. Some
                    days I'm an emotional fool and on the rest
                    of the days I choose emotions and feelings
                    over logic because I listen to my heart and
                    it maybe wrong but I'd rather blame myself
                    for anything that has happened, than
                    anyone or anything else. And on these days
                    you knowingly or unknowingly help sort my
                    feelings and make them clear for me to
                    realise the sense of what I'm feeling and to
                    be able to do that is just amazing.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    ✨You✨ are the constantly happening
                    nice thing in my life kanooo, I'd probably
                    loose my mind without you!
                    Do you have any idea how spoilt I am right now? Thanks to you now I have an attitude
                    to all my problems, I tell them "bitch
                    please, my boyfriend is one call away and
                    he'll come and take me away from all of
                    these". You are an escape from
                    reality and yet so real. You give me both, a
                    subtle reality check and princess
                    treatment that gets me wondering how
                    lucky I got with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes there is no reason to how I feel
                    about you except that it's real and true
                    You do you babe, I have so much faith in
                    you, your ambitions and feelings that I
                    shall stay by your side when it gets bitter,
                    salty, sweet, spicy, anything at all  because I
                    believe at the end of the day, we can make
                    it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've told you all of these to make you
                    realise what an amazing human you are!
                    And on this special special day my
                    beautiful human gets an year older and wiser than he already is! I didn't know
                    birthdays could get me so excited until it
                    was yours!
                    Happy happy birthday love ❤ I am forever
                    grateful for your existence and so are your
                    friends and family. I promise to love you
                    more and more with every passing day.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    With love,<br>
